Information on Student Elections (updated 9/14)

Most offices are voted on in the spring.  Freshmen positions are voted on in the fall.  Students must complete nomination papers to become a candidate for any elected student office. 

Nomination Procedure
1)    Pick up nomination papers at the designated location.
2)    Obtain the requisite number of signatures (50) from your classmates.
3)    Submit the papers by the due date.
4)    The earlier you turn in your nomination papers, the higher on the ballot your name will appear.

Campaign Statements
Candidates for all offices except Class Council must post a campaign statement saying why you are running for office on the designated bulletin board in Commons I.  This must be on a single 8½” x 11” sheet of paper.

Running for Multiple Offices
You may run for more than one office.  However, you must submit separate nomination papers for each office, with the exception of the combination of Class Office/Class Council.  You may not hold more than one office.  If you are elected to multiple positions, you must resign all but one.  This allows for greater participation and diversity of officeholders.
Publicity and Posters
All campaign signs and posters must be initialed by a faculty Senate member.  Please get the original signed before making copies!  Campaign posters may not be hung before the designated date.

Campaign Ethics
•    Total campaign expenditures may not exceed $25.00, including, but not limited to, printing expenses for campaign posters and items to give away to potential voters.  The actual retail value of any items provided to the candidate for free or at a significant discount will also count toward the $25.00 cap.
•    In accordance with school rules, candidates may not distribute food items, including candy, to potential voters.
•    Candidates are permitted to distribute small items to potential voters, so long as the following conditions are met:
o    The spending and food restrictions are followed.
o    The items are evenly distributed without any understanding that accepting the item constitutes an obligation to vote for that candidate.
•    All candidates will be required to sign on their nomination form that they are aware of and agree to abide by these rules.

Voting
Voting takes place in homerooms. You must have a No. 2 pencil to vote as we use Scantron ballots.

Elected Positions

School Government
Lexington High School Student/Faculty Senate: The Senate determines policies and rules for the school, as determined by the Lexington High School Constitution. It is made up of teachers and students who meet together during X Block. Each class elects approximately ten senators (the number of senators varies with the total school enrollment each year according to the rules in the LHS Senate Constitution).  Please be aware that the Senate has a strict attendance policy, so please only run if you can commit to attending Senate meetings.

Board of Appeals: The Board of Appeals consists of four students (one from each grade) and two faculty members, all elected for a one-year term. The purpose of the Board of Appeals is to address student and teacher grievances. The Board of Appeals also handles Community Service appeals.

School Council Representative: One rising sophomore and one rising junior are elected to serve a one-year and two-year term, respectively, to the LHS School Council.  The Council consists of parent, faculty, student, and community representatives and serves as an advisory committee to the administration and is responsible for creating the annual School Improvement Plan.

School Committee Representative: One student is elected at large to serve as a non-voting student delegate to the Lexington School Committee.  The School Committee is responsible for policy issues at the district level and with the school budget process.
Class Representation

Class Officers: Your class will elect students to the following class offices:
    President
    Vice President
    Secretary
    Treasurer
These officers are responsible for running the Class Council.
