The Senate Standing Committee on Student Elections will oversee the running of (a) voting center(s). Students who wish to participate in the elections must state their student ID number. Once identified they will then have their name crossed off a list of all the student in the school to prevent ballot box stuffing and repeat voting. The student will then fill out a scantron ballot and place it in the ballot box marked for their class.
The voting center will open 45 minutes prior to the beginning of classes and will close 45 minutes after the end of classes on student election day. Announcements will be made during the day to remind students to vote. Elections for each class will be held separately. Students are not permitted to monitor the elections for their own class.
