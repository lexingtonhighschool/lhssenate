An act to create the FirstClass Acceptable Use Committee.

Lexington High School is in the process of creating school email accounts for the entire student body so that students and faculty can communicate and share conferences within the FirstClass email and conferencing system.

At the earliest possible date following passage of this bill and thereafter at the beginning of each school year the Senate Communications Committee will appoint a body referred to as the FirstClass Acceptable Use Committee. This committee will, at a minimum, consist of one dean, one member of the technology staff, two members of the faculty and three members of the student body. The purpose of this committee is to oversee student use of FirstClass.

Duties will include but are not restricted to:

1. Establishing a timetable and procedure for the initial granting of student accounts.

2. Establishing policies for creating and controlling student and student/faculty conferences.

3. Defining or refining the acceptable use policy.

4. Educating students and faculty on matters of acceptable use.

5. Hearing grievances and ruling on alleged abuses of acceptable use.

6. Referring students to the administration for disciplinary sanctions when appropriate.

7. Working with the administrator of FirstClass for the purpose regulating student access to FirstClass.

The committee's oversight will be restricted to student use of FirstClass and may not rule on acceptable use by the faculty.

Rationale:

• Mandatory formation of such a committee is specified in the grant that funds student access to FirstClass.

• The duties of the committee meet a critical concern of the FirstClass administrator.
