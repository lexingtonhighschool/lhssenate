After the election, every student Senator will be assigned 2-4 homerooms of the same graduation year (when possible including their own HR). They will be expected to make monthly visits to each of their assigned homerooms during their following term as Senator, where they will solicit ideas for bills and share what Senate is doing/has done.

Senators will be able to be excused from their own homeroom for this purpose 2-3 times per month.

Rationale:
Student Senators tend to be highly connected, motivated and capable. However, they represent their entire class, so they should be given the time and expectation to meet with a constituent group of classmates. This will also improve Senator name recognition, and awareness and efficacy of the Senate as a whole.
