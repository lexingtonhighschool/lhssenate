Students may, only lunch blocks only, eat their lunches outside in the grassy areas between D-building and C-building.
This eating area excludes all black-topped and overhang areas between C-D-F and Science buildings. Food will not be allowed in these areas.
Those utilizing the area during the lunch block will be responsible for keeping the area clean.
A subcommittee appointed by the moderator will evaluate whether those utilizing this area are respecting the property and controlling litter.
On the first school day of every month, this committee shall report its findings to the principal, and the principal shall be empowered to determine whether the privilege requested in part 1 of this bill shall be continued or denied.
The area specified in this bill shall not be used as a gathering spot for students at any other time during the day.
