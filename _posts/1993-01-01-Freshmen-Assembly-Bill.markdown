The freshmen assembly to educate students about school government positions will be during A-Block on Thursday of the first full week of classes in September.
The format will consist of five (5 minute) presentations:
5 minutes for Senate
5 minutes for Class Council
5 minutes for School Committee Representative
5 minutes for Site-Based Council Representative
5 minutes for Board of Appeals

The responsibility for the assembly will fall to the Senate Elections Committee which will organize and select speakers. This planning and selection should take place the previous spring so the assembly will be ready to go upon return in the fall.
