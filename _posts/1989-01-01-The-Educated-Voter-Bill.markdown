The elections committee will explore methods that will allow candidates for President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer to speak before members of his/her class, electronically or otherwise. Any method chosen will be subject to final approval by the whole Senate body.
The elections committee will see that each candidate for a student government position is given the opportunity to write a statement on his/her views, and that the statement is distributed through homerooms to all students in the same graduating class as the candidate.
The elections committee will be able to set reasonable limits for the length of speeches and/or statements.
