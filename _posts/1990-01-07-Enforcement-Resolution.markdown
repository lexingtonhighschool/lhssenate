The Senate resolves that the administration should more vigilantly enforce and communicate policies passed by the Senate to the school community.

Rationale

The Senate has passed numerous bills that have not been enforced by the administration, the proper agent for enforcement. This lack of enforcement has, in all likelihood, diminished the importance and power of the Senate in the eyes of the school community. More importantly, the policies the Senate has created have not been implemented.
