Lunch periods may not be shortened from their current lengths, either due to a special schedule such as an extended homeroom, or due to a permanent change in the master schedule.

Rationale:
Lunch is important to ensure the health and general well being of students and faculty. Students and faculty need adequate time to eat lunch.
