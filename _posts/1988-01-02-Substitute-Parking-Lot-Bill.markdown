All parking stickers available be allocated to students on a first-come, first-serve basis.
All applications for stickers will be time-dated to establish the order of issuance. Criteria for eligibility and availability will be established by the Administrative Team, subject to the approval of the Senate.
Of the spaces available to students, that 5 be held in reserve for short term permits for special parking needs to be determined by the principal.
Once eligibility has been established, the student must pay a non-refundable annual parking fee that will be established by the School Committee.
The principal, or his designee, will have the power to revoke the parking privileges of any student. All decisions regarding denial or revocation of parking privileges are subject to appeal under the provisions provided for by the Constitution.
Any student whose parking privilege is revoked shall lose his/her sticker/space to the next person on the waiting list, and will be placed at the end of the current waiting list, and the privilege will not be regained until all those ahead on the waiting list have received spaces/stickers.
The principal and other administrators will be responsible for the discipline of those who park vehicles without proper L.H.S. stickers and /or who do not park in the spaces defined by painted lines.
All parking spaces in the student and faculty parking lots shall be numbered.
