The School Climate Committee of the Senate will create a system that will allow for the general opinion of the student body to be expressed to the Senate. This system will consist of random polling of homerooms representing all four grades in the high school. Polling will take place when the Senate requests information on a given topic. School Climate Committee members will run the polling, and results will be given at the following week's meeting.
