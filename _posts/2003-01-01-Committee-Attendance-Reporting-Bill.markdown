Commencing with the next scheduled Senate meeting, each committee chair (or designee) will formally report the attendance at the previous committee meeting. These reports of committee attendance will be communicated to the Secretary and placed in the official minutes of the Senate.

Rationale: Attendance at committee meetings is important and necessary in order for the Senate to properly attend to its responsibilities. Official, public reporting of a Senator√ås attendance at both Senate and committee meetings provides the electorate the opportunity to have this information. This approach to committee attendance is public, straightforward, easy to administer, and not punitive.
