In the event a teacher is absent, classes consisting of exclusively seniors and juniors may be cancelled by the teacher provided that: 1. the teacher feels that the students' time would be more productively employed elsewhere, and 2. an assignment is left for the students. If the absence extends beyond two days, substitute coverage and plans should be provided.
