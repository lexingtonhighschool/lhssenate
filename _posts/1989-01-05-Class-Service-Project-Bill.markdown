This bill has been replaced by the <a href="/lhssenate/bills/2011/01/02/Class-Council-Community-Service-Bill/">Class Council Community Service Bill</a>.

Beginning in the Academic year 1990-1991, all class councils at Lexington High School shall be required to sponsor at least one event over the course of each academic year organized specifically for the purpose of contributing to a community service effort.

The activity that each class chooses as its community service project must be approved by the community service coordinator. No student may claim or credit any work done on a class sponsored project or event for their community service graduation requirement.

The Social Action Committee of the Senate shall monitor each class council annually to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled.
