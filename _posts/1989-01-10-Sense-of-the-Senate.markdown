The sense of the Senate regarding the exclusivity of X-block is that scheduling meetings during this time stands to infringe upon the integrity of the Senate as a governing power.
The constitution states in article IV, section 3 that:
C. The scheduling of practices, rehearsals, and other required meetings is strictly prohibited during Senate meeting times.
E. No teacher shall be assigned any involuntary professional duty while the Senate is in session.
It is the feeling of the Senate that, in order to protect the integrity of the Senate, clarification of Article IV, Section 3 C is necessary. Therefore we have stated that:
Any activity, extra-help or make-up session, detention, practice, rehearsal, or meeting which is regularly scheduled and/or offered only during X-block is considered in violation of the Constitution.
