Students and faculty may place posters for school or club related events and meetings on interior walls and on the end sections of lockers throughout the LHS campus. Such notices are to be hung with masking tape only. Posters must be approved and initialed by the activity's faculty advisor or a dean, who will ensure that only a reasonable number of posters will be hung. All posters must have a date of removal on them unless they refer to a specific event, and posterers are expected to remove posters immediately after the event or on the specified date. All possible efforts will be made to recycle the posters.

It is the Climate Committee's responsibility to designate and maintain an area (or areas) for posters not related to school activities. Posters may be placed in this area by students, faculty and staff, and need no faculty or dean's signature or removal date. It is expected that the community will show good judgment in selecting the quantity and size of posters placed in this area so that all messages can be accommodated.

Rationale:
This bill amends, expands and replaces the 4-89/8-90 Poster Bill.

Postering is an important right of free speech which benefits the LHS community. This bill is intended to preserve that right to the greatest extent possible. It is expected that posters may be provocative and even offensive to some, but that no personal attacks will be tolerated.
