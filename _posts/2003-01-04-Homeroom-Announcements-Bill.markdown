Announcements regarding student activities will be posted to the school's electronic communications system. The Communications Committee will appoint moderators to post announcements and designate a faculty member of the committee to be responsible for their content. It is the responsibility of homeroom teachers to ensure that announcements are read or heard by their students.

The Pledge, if read, will be read over the PA during the first minute of homeroom.

When necessary, the administration may still choose to make special announcements over the PA, although this is expected to be kept to a minimum.

Rationale:
This bill eliminates announcements over the PA, except for vital and timely announcements the administration may choose to make. This allows homerooms to operate autonomously. Teachers and students may structure the homeroom period in whatever way they choose, both to deliver announcements and to carry out all the other activities for which this time is provided.

This bill replaces the 2-98 Student Announcement Bill and any lost announcement bills passed during the recent Dark Ages

A survey conducted after a four week trial period showed that a majority of students and faculty supported a written announcement system.

This bill replaces the 2-98 Student Announcement Bill and any lost announcement bills passed during the recent Dark Ages of Senate Record keeping.
