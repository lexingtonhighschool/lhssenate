I. Students will be allowed to drop or add a class only within the first four weeks of a term, or semester (for semester courses), except under one of the following conditions:

a. Both teacher and student agree that the course has been too difficult or too easy for the student and a change of levels is both warranted and requested.
b. The student has a medical reason for lightening or modifying his/her schedule.
c. The student has a scheduling conflict.

II. There will be no lateral transfers unless there is a scheduling conflict or if there is a mutually perceived conflict between the teacher and the student.

III. Students will not be allowed to officially drop a class unless all books and other course materials are returned to the teacher of the course being dropped.

IV. A student should not be allowed to add or drop a class unless a consultation is first made among the teachers involved, the department head/coordinator and the student's guidance counselor.

V. A teacher will not allow a student to enter his/her classroom unless the student produces a form signed by the teacher of the course being dropped, the teacher of the course being added, the department head/coordinator and the student's guidance counselor. This document should also indicate the current grade of the student in the course being dropped.
