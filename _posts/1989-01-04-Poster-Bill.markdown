Students and faculty may post publicity posters for school or club related event and meetings on interior brick and concrete walls and on sections of lockers throughout the LHS campus. Such notices are to be hung with masking tape. Those who put up the posters will be responsible for their removal after the event. Posters must be approved by the activity's faculty advisor and/or student activities coordinator. Said advisor will ensure that only a reasonable amount of posters will be posted. All possible efforts will be made to recycle the posters.
