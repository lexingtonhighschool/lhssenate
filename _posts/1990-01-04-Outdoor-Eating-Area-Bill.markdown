Students may, during lunch block only, eat their lunches outside in the grassy area between C-building and D-building.
This eating area excludes the blacktop and overhang areas between C-D-F and the Science building. Food will not be allowed in those areas.
Those utilizing this area during lunch block will be responsible for keeping the area clean.
A subcommittee appointed by the Senate moderator will evaluate whether those utilizing the area are respecting the property and controlling litter.
On the first school day of every month, this committee will report its findings to the principal, and the principal shall be empowered to determine whether the privilege granted in part one of this bill shall be continued or temporarily denied.
The area specified in this bill shall not be used as a gathering spot for students at any other time during the day.
