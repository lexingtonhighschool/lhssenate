Exclusively senior classes may be canceled by the classroom teacher provided that:

the teacher feels that student time would be more productively employed elsewhere
an assignment is left for the students

This process will be implemented for one semester, after which time a committee comprised of representatives of the LHS Senate, the principal, and the assistant principals shall meet to determine the future and possible expansion of this program.

Rationale
This bill provides the opportunity to test the idea of canceling classes rather than having substitutes. It is believed that this bill will save significant money for the Lexington school system, and avoid the unproductive use of time that substitutes can cause.
