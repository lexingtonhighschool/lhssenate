The Executive Committee will hold a voluntary, informal orientation for all new senators on the Tuesday afternoon immediately preceding the first Senate meeting which newly elected Senators will attend. The Executive Committee will inform new senators of typical senate procedures, provide an overview of each senate committee, and answer questions. 
Rationale: 
Currently, new senators are given no instructive information before attending their first senate meeting. This lack of information causes new senators unnecessary confusion and unfamiliarity with the senate. 
If new senators are informed, prepared, and feel comfortable before attending their first senate meeting, they will be more likely to contribute their opinions.
