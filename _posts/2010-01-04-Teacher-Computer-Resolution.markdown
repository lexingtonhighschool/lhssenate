Resolved: The Student-Faculty Senate encourages teachers to allow students to use their computers during free blocks or study halls.

Rationale:
1. Opening up classroom computers would reduce traffic and occupancy in the library.
2. Teachers can have greater control over their students' use of free blocks/studies because they can choose to monitor them in their own classroom.
3. Students will have greater work efficiency with easier access to computers.
4. It should be made clear that there are no security risks associated with student use of computers. Grades, tests, etc. will remain on the teacher's account, and the student must use their own in order to access the computer.
