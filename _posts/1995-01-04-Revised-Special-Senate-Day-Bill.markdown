Each year, on the second Wednesday of December, the Student/Faculty Senate will sponsor a special open meeting to which all members of the community will be expressly invited to ask questions and/or provide ideas for the Senate body to consider.
Throughout the school day of the Special Senate Day and of the Tuesday preceding it, each senator must wear an item of identification indicating his or her status as a LHS senator. Senate tables will be set up on these two days to allow students and faculty to interact with senators.
The Special Senate Day will be advertised by the Communications Committee through announcements and posters.
Parts I, II, and III of this bill clarify and amend the procedures outlined in the Special Senate Day Bill of 1994. This bill must not be interpreted as nullification of the entirety of the previous bill.
