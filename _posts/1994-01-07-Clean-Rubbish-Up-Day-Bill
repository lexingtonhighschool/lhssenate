The Lexington High School Student/Faculty Senate will sponsor an annual advertised, school-wide clean up hour during X block every last Wednesday in March. The target of the clean-up hour, organized by the Executive Committee of the Senate, will be to clean up outdoor areas that are frequently used and frequently littered. The Senate will meet in "field trip" form outside. Attendance will be taken by the secretary of the senate in a headquarters decided on by the Executive Committee.
