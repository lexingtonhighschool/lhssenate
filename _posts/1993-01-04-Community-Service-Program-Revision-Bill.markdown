Each student will be required to perform 40 hours of approved community service during his/her four years at Lexington High School.
Community service will be required of each student for graduation. Students will be expected to complete 20 hours of community service by the beginning of their junior year. If students have not completed 20 hours by this time, their privilege of open campus will be withheld until they do so.
If a student arrives midway through the four years of his/her high school career (junior year), the student will be expected to complete 20 hours of community service. After the first quarter of the senior year, any new arrival to the high school will have the community service requirement waived.
This community service program revision will go into effect with the class of 1998.
