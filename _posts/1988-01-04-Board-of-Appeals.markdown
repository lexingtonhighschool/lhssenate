The Board of Appeals will consist of six student members, two seniors, two juniors, one sophomore, one freshman, and three faculty members, all elected for a one-year term. Elections will be held at the same time as the Senate elections. A member of the Senate may not be a member of the Board of Appeals.

The Board of Appeals will elect a chairperson and a secretary from its members.
