Within the first full week of school each year there will be a mandatory assembly for all freshmen to educate them about school government positions. Two members of the Senate, a Board of Appeals Representative, a School Committee representative, and two Class Council members will speak about their positions at this time. These speakers will be upper class persons who currently hold offices in these organizations. These groups will be comprised of seniors whenever possible.
