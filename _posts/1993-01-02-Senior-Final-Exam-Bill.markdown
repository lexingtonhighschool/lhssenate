Final exams for senior courses will be administered during the last week of senior classes. The testing format will be the same as the format used for administering final exams for non-senior courses. Exam sessions will be one and one half hours in length. There will be two regular exam sessions on each of three days. Each exam session will be reserved for exams in a specific subject area/department. Two sessions will be devoted to foreign language courses to accommodate those students enrolled in two foreign language courses. Students who miss an exam due to an excused absence may make up that exam during and additional afternoon session on one of the three exam days or at a time agreed upon by teacher and student.
