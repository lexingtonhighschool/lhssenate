Each student will be required to perform twenty hours of approved community service during his/her four years at Lexington High School.
Community service will be required of each student for graduation. (See appendix for approved list of service activities)
This community service requirement for graduation will be added as a new cluster and will start with the incoming class of September 1988.
If a student arrives midway through the four years of his/her high school career, the requirement will still be in affect. After the first quarter of the senior year, any new arrival to the high school will have the community service requirement waived.
Opportunities for community service will be offered to the classes of 1989, 1990, and 1991 but will not be apart of graduation requirement. Credit will be available under Cluster VI if a student in one of those classes does any community service.
