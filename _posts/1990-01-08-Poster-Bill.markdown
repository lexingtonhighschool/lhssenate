Students and faculty may post publicity posters for school or club related events and meetings on interior brick and concrete walls and on the end sections of lockers throughout the LHS campus. Such notices are to be hung with Scotch or masking tape only. Those who put up the posters will be responsible for their removal within one school week after the event. Posters must be approved by the activity's faculty advisor and/or by the student activities coordinator. Said advisor will insure that only a reasonable amount of posters will be hung. All possible efforts will be made to recycle the posters.
